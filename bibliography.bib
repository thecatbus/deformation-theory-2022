	abstract = {"The basic problem of deformation theory in algebraic geometry involves watching a small deformation of one member of a family of objects, such as varieties, or subschemes in a fixed space, or vector bundles on a fixed scheme. In this new book, Robin Hartshorne studies first what happens over small infinitesimal deformations, and then gradually builds up to more global situations, using methods pioneered by Kodaira and Spencer in the complex analytic case, and adapted and expanded in algebraic geometry by Grothendieck. Topics include: deformations over the dual numbers; smoothness and the infinitesimal lifting property; Zariski tangent space and obstructions to deformation problems; pro-representable functors of Schlessinger; infinitesimal study of moduli spaces such as the Hilbert scheme, Picard scheme, moduli of curves, and moduli of stable vector bundles. The author includes numerous exercises, as well as important examples illustrating various aspects of the theory. This text is based on a graduate course taught by the author at the University of California, Berkeley."--},

  abstract = {Suppose that f : X \textrightarrow{} Spec R is a minimal model of a complete local Gorenstein 3-fold, where the fibres of f are at most one dimensional, so by [VdB] there is a noncommutative ring {$\Lambda$} derived equivalent to X. For any collection of curves above the origin, we show that this collection contracts to a point without contracting a divisor if and only if a certain factor of {$\Lambda$} is finite dimensional, improving a result of [DW2]. We further show that the mutation functor of [IW2, \textsection 6] is functorially isomorphic to the inverse of the Bridgeland\textendash Chen flop functor in the case when the factor of {$\Lambda$} is finite dimensional, and else the mutation functor is a twist functor over a noncommutative one-dimensional scheme. These results then allow us to jump between all the minimal models of Spec R in an algorithmic way, without having to compute the geometry at each stage. We call this process the Homological MMP.},
